40 slides for 45 minutes talk


- Add text to slides and where to ask questions etc.
- Add details such as Tg of carbon sequestration and how much that actually is and what the value of seagrasses and macroalgae is

- Bring dried kelp to the presentation?
 
- How do humans use kelp?

- Ask questions to the audience : Why do we have fjords in Norway?

- How high is the diversity in macroalgal beds and seagrass in comparison to bare rock or sand?

- Put questions throughout the presentation that the audience has to answer.



Time structure:
Climate change: 4 mins

Why is the impact important: 5 mins - 14 mins
What factor has the biggest impact: 5 mins - 19 mins
Impact on genetic diversity: 10 mins - 29 mins
Impact on species diversity: 10 mins - 39 mins












I have gone through the following points but don't want to remove them from this file yet.

- Differences between seagrass and seaweed https://www.google.com/search?q=what+are+the+differences+between+seagrass+and+seaweed&client=ubuntu&hs=evo&channel=fs&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwicgoO32LThAhU6wcQBHauqCFUQ_AUIDigB&biw=1175&bih=591#imgrc=BhoTgr-HtMkf1M:

Then introduce the climate change impact on these systems: Warming and acidification (growth increases partly)

Are populations of low diversity really endangered?


Epigenetic variation in seagrass might contradict this.
