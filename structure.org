40 slides for 45 minutes talk


- Add text to slides and where to ask questions etc.

- Bring dried kelp to the presentation?
 
- How high is the diversity in macroalgal beds and seagrass in comparison to bare rock or sand?

- Put questions throughout the presentation that the audience has to answer.



Time structure:
Climate change: 5 mins
What are ocean forests: 5 mins - 10 mins
Why is the impact important: 5 mins - 15 mins
What factor has the biggest impact: 4 mins (measured 3) - 19 mins
Range shifts of ocean forests: 8 mins - 27 mins
Impact on genetic diversity: 8 mins - 32 mins
Impact on species diversity: 8 mins - 40 mins












I have gone through the following points but don't want to remove them from this file yet.

Are populations of low diversity really endangered?


Epigenetic variation in seagrass might contradict this.
