			<!-- Zostera shoots can remain positively buoyant for ca. 2 weeks, allowing for long-distance dispersal -->
			<aside class="notes">
			  Poleward range extension depends on the
			  ability of the species to disperse and
			  migrate. Since zygotes generally disperse
			  less than 10 m from the egg-bearing female,
			  long-range dispersal thus must involve
			  drifting thalli of reproductively mature
			  individuals. Some species have air bladders
			  that allow them to drift. For the others,
			  shipping transport will likely play a major
			  role. As shipping has increased in the
			  Canadian and Russian Arctic in response to
			  the loss of Arctic sea ice, it is likely to
			  play a major role in the introduction of
			  marine species into polar areas, including
			  marine macroalgae.

			Initially, we expect tropical herbivorous

			meadows, followed later by megafauna. Tropical
			seagrasses are likely to establish later,
			delayed by more limited dispersal
			abilities. Ultimately, food webs are likely to
			shift from primarily seagrass-detritus to more

			affecting a range of important ecosystem
			services that seagrasses provide, including
			their nursery habitat role for fishery
			species, carbon sequestration, and the
			provision of organic matter to other
			ecosystems in temperate regions. Increasing
			herbivory is particularly impacting in the
			winter months when light availability is
			limited. Green turtles already occur in small

			<aside class="notes">
			Milancovick cycles are astronomic cycles that influence the relative position of the earth to the sun. These cycles were likely ampliefied by changes in ocean currents that transport heat across the globe, by Co2, which is a greenhouse gas that traps solar radiation, and by ice cover, which affects the absorbance of solar radiation.
